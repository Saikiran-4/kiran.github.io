        As we have many university student chapters worldwide, so do we at VIGNAN. The VIGANA ACM student chapter was introduced in the year 2018, with the support of our Head of The Department, Dr.BODDE PRASAD. The students here get an opportunity to interact and learn a lot from their peers. Over the past few years, many fests have been organised where the students were able to showcase their latent skills in various technical and non-technical fields. By organising a number of interactive sessions, the student chapter encourages the students to discuss and implement their ideas in the field of computer science.
